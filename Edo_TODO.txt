Edo:

I think the RPG direction is really awesome.

Things that I think could really help with your journey:

1. Look at existing AI based RPG games, play around with them
Understand what you like and what you don't like about them.

2. Build your game around the 1 central feature that you think is the 
most interesting/exciting of the AI based RPG games that you experienced.

AI Dungeon is the one that I know. 

Write a short game design/game concept document, and let AI prototype it and have a feel for it.

To make it easier, start with a chat based game.

I really like the exp system. I am thinking like what are designs of other
- Reward systems
- Stories inside the games 
- Characters gaining skills/attributes
- HP

1. Look at the relationship between the files
(What each file is doing)
(What architectural reasons are the different files occupying)

2. Look at the main functions inside each file, and what the functions are doing

3, Understand the flow of data (this is the most important thing when debugging full-stack applications)

What I mean by understanding the data flow is this:

I, as a user, goes to http://localhost:3000/dashboard.html.

This event is handled by the frontend. Questions: a) What file has the logic, b) Which functions is handling that logic

The frontend has to give this to the backend. Questions: a) What file has the logic, b) Which functions is handling that logic
c) Where are the data stored in the backedn?
(Question c) is important for you since you need to store all of these statistics, and these statistics are stored in the backend)

The backend gives the data back to the frontend, and is displayed to the user.

4. Which part of the data flow is wrong? How is the data not flowing over back to me as the user?

To diagnose this, add logging. Eliminate steps of the data flow that is working, and focus on the ones that may not work.
